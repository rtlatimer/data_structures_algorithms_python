If you are having trouble with this problem (or it seems to be taking a long time to run in some cases) check out the Solution Notebook and fully read the conclusion link for a detailed description of the various ways to solve this problem!\n",

    "Given a target amount **n** and a list (array) of distinct coin values, what's the fewest coins needed to make the change amount. \n",

    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If n = 10 and coins = [1,5,10]. Then there are 4 possible ways to make change:\n",

    "* 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5 + 1+1+1+1+1\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5+5\n",
    "\n",
    "* 10\n",
