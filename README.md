# Coding Data Structures and Algorithms with Python
by Robert Latimer
July 24, 2017

### Description

The goal of this repository is to practice coding basic data structures and algorithms using Python 2.7. Topics covered are:
* Lists
* Search
* Sorting
* Maps
* Hashing
* Trees
* Graphs

Each topic plays a vital role in understanding fundamental data structure and efficiency. All subjects should be known for preparation for a software coding interview.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)

### Code

All code from this repository came from Udacity's ['Technical Interview' course](https://www.udacity.com/course/technical-interview--ud513).

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `data_structures_algorithms_python/` (that contains this README) and run the following command:

```python ______.py```

In place of `______.py` insert the code you wish to execute.
